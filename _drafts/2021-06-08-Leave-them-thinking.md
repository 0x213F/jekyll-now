# Leave them thinking

You don't have much time left, so how do you end things?

So long as you remain confident on your standpoint, trust that people will stand by your side.

Leave them thinking for you.

<!-- You need to build roots and invest in getting feedback from your companies shareholders (customers, clients, staff, etc)

Who are you speaking to? Leave them thinking for you.

You want to optimize for larger involvement -->
