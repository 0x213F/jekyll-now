## Introduction

[**12.38**](https://youtu.be/gezFLhUznSk?t=758) is the beginning of a story expressed through both lyrics and song.

A simple example of this is at [14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=852&v=gezFLhUznSk). Donald says:

> Nah. I'll put on the radio, though.

Shortly after, you can hear the radio phase in.

## Pt. 1

Early in the track Donald ingests some psilocybin mushrooms.

> Ayy, I don't know what psilocybin is.<br>
> This better not be no molly.

Halfway through the song, Donald's partner tells him:

> Let's go outside.<br>
> You wanna be outside for this.

And so they both venture outside.

## Pt. 2

While they walk they discuss their relationship.  in the middle of a conversation about their relationship. Donald's partner presents a many audio cues lead the listener to anticipate the end of the song. Anticipation builds  the song keeps going (with only a few added audio distortions).

By [18.42](https://youtu.be/gezFLhUznSk?t=1122), the drugs are really starting to kick in. Donald is rushing home for safety. In other words, _Donald is tripping balls_.
