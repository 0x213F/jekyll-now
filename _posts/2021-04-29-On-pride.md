In my experience, it has become commonplace for people to ask the following question in a job interview:

## **The Question**

> Describe the work you are most proud of?

## Hypothesis

<span style="color: red;">Pride</span> is a feeling that I try to stay away from.

# Definition

<span style="color: red;">Pride</span> is defined as:

> A feeling of deep pleasure or satisfaction derived from one's own _achievements_.

# Proof

**The Question** infers that pleasure is derived from "_achievement_."

If I am, that is the most I can be. While I am, what I can do is fixed.

In other words, to _be_ is to _achieve_.

## Conclusion

To _be_ is to <span style="color: blue;">_be prideful_.</span>
