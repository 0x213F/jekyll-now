## Introduction

[**12.38**](https://youtu.be/gezFLhUznSk?t=758) is the beginning of a story expressed through both lyrics and song.

A simple example of this is at [14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=852&v=gezFLhUznSk). Donald says:

> Nah. I'll put on the radio, though.

Shortly after, you can hear the radio phase in.

## Pt. 1

Early in the track Donald ingests some psilocybin mushrooms.

> Ayy, I don't know what psilocybin is.<br>
> This better not be no molly.

Halfway through the song, Donald's partner tells him:

> Let's go outside.<br>
> You wanna be outside for this.

And so they both venture outside.

## Pt. 2

While they walk they discuss their relationship. By the end of the conversation, Donald is having an existential crisis.

Towards the end of the song, the _audio experience_ brings the listener into the _feeling that Donald is experiencing in the story_.

Audio cues bring the listener to anticipate the end of the song. Defying expectations, the song continues to go on.

**This is an artistic statement.**

By [18.42](https://youtu.be/gezFLhUznSk?t=1122), the drugs are really starting to kick in. Donald is rushing home for safety. In other words, _Donald is tripping balls_.
