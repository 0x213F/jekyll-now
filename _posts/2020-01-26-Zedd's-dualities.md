## Dualities

The duality of introversion is that it both _creates a safe space for self admiration_ while also _building a pressing force towards extroversion_.

The duality of extroversion is that it both _stimulates growth by experience_ while also _building a pressing force towards introversion_.

Acknowledging the _forces connecting_ introversion and extroversion has brought great clarity to my being. As such, I try my best to home in on the rhythm between forces and harmoniously dance within them.

## Zedd

Consider these forces in context of relationships.

**Kehlani**’s vocal performance on [**Good Thing**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMla2ZIz7-4) accurately depicts _the state of resisting a large pressing force towards extroversion_.

**Katy Perry**’s vocal performance on [**365**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrbgUtCfnC0) accurately depicts _the state of resisting a large pressing force towards introversion_.
