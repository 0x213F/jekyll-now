Bad decisions are bound to happen. How bad decisions are created means everything.

## Individual

When it comes to an _individual_ performance, faults and weaknesses are expected.

## Collective

Analyzing the _collective_ performance, outcomes are tolerated.

## In other words

If _one person_ makes a decision, they are accountable for its ripple effects.

If _the collective_ makes the decision, then will tolerate its results.

## My recommendation

Drop the autocracy. **Adopt a democracy.**

Relinquish control of the company to a democratic process. I doubt 1/3 of employees would have quit if this problem was resolved by a collective decision.

<u>Democracy is something you need to further implement in your workplace.</u> If you doubt this, ask your employees:

> "Would you benefit from additional democratic decision making processes?"

You risk a recurrent controversy, unless you **address this problem at its root cause**.
