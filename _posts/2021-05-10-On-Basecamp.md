Bad decisions are bound to happen. **How** bad decisions are created means everything.

## Individual

When it comes to an _individual's performance_, faults and weaknesses are expected.

## Collective

While analyzing a _collective's performance_, undesirable outcomes are tolerated.

## In other words

If _one person_ makes a decision, it might be a bad one. That individual is solely accountable for what follows.

If _the collective_ makes a decision, the result will be tolerated amongst each individual that helped make the decision.

Personally, I doubt that 1/3 of company employees would have quit if this was a collective decision.

## My recommendation

**Make more decisions democratically.**

<u>Democracy is something you need to further implement in your workplace.</u> If you doubt this, ask your employees:

> "Would you benefit from additional democratic decision making processes?"

You must **address this problem at its root cause**, otherwise <u>you risk a recurrent controversy</u>.
