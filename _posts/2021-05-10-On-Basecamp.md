It was bound to happen.

As an _individual_, imperfection is <span style="color: red;">inevitable</span>.

As a _collective_, imperfection is <span style="color: blue;">tolerated</span>.

If _one person_ makes a decision, <span style="color: red;">one person is accountable</span> for the ripple effects of the decision.

If _the collective_ makes the decision, then <span style="color: blue;">the collective will tolerate</span> whatever the results are.

My recommendation: drop the autocracy and adopt a democracy. Relinquish control of the company to a democratic process. I doubt 1/3 of employees would have quit if this was resolved as a collective.

Democracy is something you need to further implement in your workplace. If you doubt this, ask your employees: "Would you benefit from additional democratic decision making processes?" If you fail to address this problem at the root cause, you risk a recurrent controversy.
