## Introduction

[**12.38**](https://youtu.be/gezFLhUznSk?t=758) is the beginning of a story told not only through lyrics, but also through its complex structure.

A simple example of this is at [14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=852&v=gezFLhUznSk). Donald says he is going to listen to the radio. Shortly after, you can hear the radio phase in.  

## Pt. 1  

Taking a step back - consider the bigger picture.   Early in the track Donald accidentally ingests some psilocybin mushrooms.

> Ayy, I don't know what psilocybin is.<br>
> This better not be no molly.

Halfway through the song, Donald's partner tells him:

> Let's go outside.<br>
> You wanna be outside for this.

  And so they both venture outside.  

## Pt. 2

By the end of the song, many audio cues lead the listener to anticipate the end of the song. Defying expectations, the song keeps going (with only a few added audio distortions).

The passive listener will consider this segment boring and uninspiring.

The active listener will understand why Donald Glover chose to make this artistic statement.

By [18.42](https://youtu.be/gezFLhUznSk?t=1122), _Donald is tripping really hard and is just trying to make it home alive_.  

> I'm almost here

## Conclusion

 **12.38** is only the beginning. Listen to [**03.15.20**](https://smarturl.it/3152020DGP) in its entirety for the full experience.
