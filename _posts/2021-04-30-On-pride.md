In my experience, it has become commonplace for <span style="color: purple;">employers</span> to ask <span style="color: DarkGray;">prospective job candidates</span> the following:

## <span style="color: orange;">Question</span>

> Describe the work you are most proud of?

## Thesis

Declarations of <span style="color: red;">pride</span> are at best disingenuous, and at worst injurious.

## Definition

<span style="color: red;">Pride</span> is defined as:

> A feeling of <span style="color: green;">deep pleasure</span> or <span style="color: green;">satisfaction</span> derived from one's own <u>achievements</u>.

## Proof

1. The <span style="color: orange;">Question</span> implies that <span style="color: green;">happiness</span> is derived from <u>working</u>.

2. Arguably, happiness should come from _being_, not <u>working</u>.

3. If _I am_, that is _the most I can be_.

4. If _I am_, the rate at which <u>I do</u> is fixed.

5. To <u>achieve</u> is to <u>do</u>.

6. To <u>work</u> is to <u>achieve</u>.

7. Therefore, to <u>work</u> is _to be_.

8. <span style="color: purple;">Employers</span> can use this <span style="color: orange;">question</span> to filter <span style="color: DarkGray;">job applicants</span> based on their <span style="color: green;">commitment</span> to <u>work</u>.

9. Use of this filter in a hiring funnel exacerbates traits that depict <span style="color: purple;">the employer</span> as:

  * Desperate (for workers)
  * Insecure (of working conditions)
  * <mark style="background-color: red; padding: 0 4px;">Manipulative</mark>

## Conclusion

Reflecting on <span style="color: red;">pride</span> can be problematic during the hiring process.

The most valid response to the <span style="color: orange;">Question</span> is:<br><br>

* <mark style="background-color: AliceBlue; padding: 0 4px;">To <span style="font-style: italic;">be</span> is to <span style="font-style: italic; color: blue;">be prideful</span>. As such, I am <span style="font-style: italic; color: blue;">most proud of being</span>.</mark><br><br>
