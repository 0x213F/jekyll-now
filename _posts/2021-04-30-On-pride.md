In my experience, it has become commonplace for employers to ask job candidates the following question:

## <span style="color: yellow;">Pride</span>The Question</span>

> Describe the work you are most proud of?

## Hypothesis

<span style="color: red;">Pride</span> is a feeling that I try to stay away from.

## Definition

<span style="color: red;">Pride</span> is defined as:

> A feeling of <span style="color: green;">deep pleasure</span> or <span style="color: green;">satisfaction</span> derived from one's own <u>achievements<u>.

## Proof

<span style="color: yellow;">The Question</span> infers that <span style="color: green;">happiness</span> is derived from "<u>achievement</u>."

If _I am_, that is _the most I can be_. While _I am_, the rate at which I do is fixed.

Achievement is reached by doing.

In other words, to _be_ is to <u>achieve</u>.

## Conclusion

To _be_ is to <span style="color: blue;">_be prideful_.</span>
