In my experience, it has become commonplace for <span style="color: purple;">employers</span> to ask <span style="color: DarkGray;">prospective job candidates</span> the following:

## <span style="color: orange;">The Question</span>

> Describe the work you are most proud of?

## Thesis

Declarations of <span style="color: red;">pride</span> are at best disingenuous, and at worst injurious.

## Definition

<span style="color: red;">Pride</span> is defined as:

> A feeling of <span style="color: green;">deep pleasure</span> or <span style="color: green;">satisfaction</span> derived from one's own <u>achievements</u>.

## Proof

1. If _I am_, that is _the most I can be_. While _I am_, the rate at which <u>I do</u> is fixed.

2. <u>Achievement</u> is reached by <u>doing</u>.

3. To <u>do</u> is to <u>work</u>. To <u>work</u> is to <u>achieve</u>.

4. Therefore, while in a "working capacity," to _be_ is to <u>work</u>.

5. <span style="color: orange;">The Question</span> implies that <span style="color: green;">happiness</span> is derived from <u>working</u>.

6. The <span style="color: DarkGray;">job applicant</span> may infer that the <span style="color: purple;">employer</span> is judging <span style="color: DarkGray;">themself</span> on their ability to be <span style="color: green;">inspired</span> and <span style="color: green;">motivated</span> to <u>work</u> for <span style="color: purple;">them</span>.

7. The <span style="color: purple;">employer</span> may use this data point, either consciously or subconsciously, to filter out <span style="color: DarkGray;">candidates</span>.

8. Hiring a <span style="color: DarkGray;">candidate</span> based off their loyalty to <u>work</u> exacerbates traits depicting <span style="color: purple;">the employer</span> as:

  * Desperate
  * Insecure
  * <mark style="background-color: red; padding: 0 4px;">Manipulative</mark>

## Conclusion

Reflecting on <span style="color: red;">pride</span> can be problematic during the hiring process.

The most valid response to <span style="color: orange;">The Question</span> is:<br><br>

* <mark style="background-color: AliceBlue; padding: 0 4px;">To <span style="font-style: italic;">be</span> is to <span style="font-style: italic; color: blue;">be prideful</span>. As such, I am <span style="font-style: italic; color: blue;">most proud of being</span>.</mark><br><br>
