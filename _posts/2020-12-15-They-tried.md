Tyler, The Creator [tweeted a selection of his favorite songs released in 2020](https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/1337462813602717702?s=20). In a Twitter reply, he expanded on his statement to further expressed his liking of the album [**03.15.20**](https://smarturl.it/3152020DGP).

Above is a [screenshot of said Twitter reply](https://twitter.com/maximuscruzrod/status/1337501251928346624). The original has since been deleted.

In this post I unpack my interpretation of the whole situation.

## Level 1

Tyler is highlighting that Donald Glover dropped a dope album but people are sleeping on it.

## Level 2

The subtext is Tyler relating too Donald.

About a year ago, Tyler arranged [a surprise performance by Drake](https://livemusicblog.com/news/drake-makes-surprise-appearance-at-camp-flog-gnaw/). The audience was not receptive of Drake's performance.

Tyler and Donald both did dope things that fell flat to their target audiences.

## Level 3

For the uninitiated, Tyler has a history of expressing himself in opposite. He also occasionally uses a palate of coarse language.

## Level 4

Tyler does not actually think that Donald is a "dickfuck." Tyler means the exact opposite.

The reply pictured above is Tyler's endearing way of supporting Donald.

## Level 5

News outlets published the narrative that Tyler was actually mad at Donald.

Source [one](https://www.complex.com/music/2020/12/tyler-the-creator-praises-childish-gambino-3-15-20) and [two](https://uproxx.com/music/tyler-the-creator-donald-glover-3-15-20/]).

## Level 6

Once again, Tyler is being cryptic.

Once again, Tyler falls flat.

Instead of trying to explain himself, Tyler understandably deleted the reply pictured above in order to mitigate damage.

## Level 7

You may choose to justify the conclusion that both Tyler and Donald had _good intensions_ and were just _misunderstood by the masses_. [They tried](https://schultheiss.io/They-tried).

## Level 8

I would be remiss not to take this opportunity to further highlight that [**Donald Glover's album 3.15.20 was legendary**](https://schultheiss.io/No-sound).
